/**
 * A ReaderStrategy implementation which reads from ZipFiles.
 * <p>
 * May be used as a dependency for RoCrateReader. It will unzip
 * the ZipFile in a path relative to the directory this application runs in.
 * By default, it will be `./.tmp/ro-crate-java/zipReader/$UUID/`.
 * <p>
 * NOTE: The resulting crate may refer to these temporary files. Therefore,
 * these files are only being deleted before the JVM exits. If you need to free
 * space because your application is long-running or creates a lot of
 * crates, you may use the getters to retrieve information which will help
 * you to clean up manually. Keep in mind that crates may refer to this
 * folder after extraction. Use RoCrateWriter to export it so some
 * persistent location and possibly read it from there, if required. Or use
 * the ZipWriter to write it back to its source.
 *
 * @deprecated Use {@link ZipStrategy} instead.
